            This CVE references a problem with embedding certain versions of google
            chrome or using certain versions of Google V8 which may allow attackers to "have impact
            via unknown vectors." Our codebase does not embed either package so this is believed to be
            a false positive from OWASP.

            This CVE references a problem with heap-based buffer overflow in
            src/jsregexp.cc which is found in certain versions of google chrome and certain versions of
            Google V8. Since we do not depend on these packages, this is believed to be a false positive
            from OWASP.

            This CVE references a problem with deserializing specifically crafted
            serialized Java objects when using the Apache Commons Collections library. Although we use
            this library, we currently do not allow deserialization of "arbitary, user-supplied Java
            serialized data" which this vulnerability depends on.
